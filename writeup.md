## Project: Perception Pick & Place

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented
#### 1. Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.

* Statistical Outlier Filtering the number of neighboring points 6 and threshold set as 0.1, any points with mean distance larger than (mean distance+x \* std_dev) will be considered as outlier.
```
    outlier_filter = plc.make_statistical_outlier_filter()
    # Set the number of neighboring points to analyze for any given point
    outlier_filter.set_mean_k(6)
    # Set threshold scale factor
    x = 1
    # Any point with a mean distance larger than global (mean distance+x*std_dev) will be considered outlier
    outlier_filter.set_std_dev_mul_thresh(x)
    # Finally call the filter function for magic
    cloud_filtered = outlier_filter.filter()
```

#### 2. Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.  

#### 2. Complete Exercise 3 Steps.  Features extracted and SVM trained.  Object recognition implemented.
Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

### Pick and Place Setup

#### 1. For all three tabletop setups (`test*.world`), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (`pick_list_*.yaml`). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid `PickPlace` request output them to `.yaml` format.

And here's another image!

Spend some time at the end to discuss your code, what techniques you used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how you might improve it if you were going to pursue this project further.
